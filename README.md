# Neighborhood Map

This is a neighborhood map centered around west windsor, NJ. The 5 markers are 5 supermarkets that I like.

### How to use the map

1. Open 'index.html' file in your browser.
2. There are 5 supermarkets markers on the map by defaults.
3. Enter the store name in the search box on the top left corner to narrow down the search.
4. Clicking on the list will open the corresponding marker's infowindow to show more details.
5. Click on the orange up/down arrow above the search box to hide/show the filter.
6. Click on each marker to view some summary information regarding the store. The rating is retrieved through Yelp API.
7. When resizing the window, the map center keeps in west windsor, NJ. If the window is getting too small, the filter will be hidden by default, unless the user chooses to keep it open.
